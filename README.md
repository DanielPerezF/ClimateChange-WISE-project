# ClimateChange-WISE-project
Project on the relation between carbon budget and inequality aversion on regional inequalities of climate change. Group WISE (group 8) for the Climate Change and Energy modeling course.

The python notebook regional_data.ipynb is used for ingesting, processing and saving the data used for creating the shares going to each region. This is saved to each of the data folders (data_r5, data_witch17, data_ed57) and has the shares for each SSP.

The python notebook exploratory.ipynb is used for loading the results, processing them and generating the plots.

The R notebook map_plotting.Rmd can be used for generating maps. This file uses the csv files mapr5.csv, mapwitch17.csv and maped57.csv, depending on the region definition used.
